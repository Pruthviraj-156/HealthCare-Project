# HealthCare-Project

# Overview:-
This project analyzes a healthcare dataset to identify insights into stroke occurrences, risk factors, and trends. The primary objective is to use data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and advanced visualizations to highlight key metrics and provide actionable insights. Additionally, we integrate the dataset with SQL and create a dynamic, interactive dashboard in Power BI.
# Dataset:-
The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle:
[Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)
* File Name: healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv
* Description: The dataset includes patient information like age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and health conditions such as heart disease and hypertension, along with stroke 
  status (1 = stroke, 0 = no stroke).
# Objectives:-
* Data Cleaning: Prepare the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and normalizing numerical features.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Derive meaningful insights about stroke risk factors and trends using visualizations.
* SQL Integration: Store the cleaned data in an SQL database and perform structured queries to extract insights.
* Power BI Dashboard: Build a dynamic dashboard to visualize key metrics, trends, and demographic insights.
# Project Deliverables:-
* Jupyter Notebook: Contains the code for data cleaning, EDA, and SQL integration.
* SQL Queries: Scripts for extracting insights from the SQL database.
* Power BI Dashboard: An interactive dashboard showcasing KPIs and charts related to stroke insights.
* GitHub Repository: All code files, datasets, SQL scripts, Power BI files, and reports are included.
